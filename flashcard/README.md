# **EXPRESS.js**

## **Notes:**

#### **1/24/2019**
- Make sure you update you NPM packages if you run into an error then rn "node app.js".
- Can I use this in terminal only?  I need to develop a terminal-only version.

#### **11/11/2018**
- To view, run "npm app.js".
- visit "localhost:3000/hello" or any files from the "views" folder.

#### **10/20/2018**
- This directory is stable and functional.
- Simply run "node app.js" in terminal within this directory.
- Perhaps this is a good jumping off point?  Not sure.  Adiitonal notes will be added.
